# _Furniture Store Makeover_

#### _An web application for a furniture store, Created 5/2/19, Updated 5/7/19_

#### By _**Micaela Jawor**_

## Description

A website (using Javascript) where users may enter a type of furniture (ie: “chair”, "rug", etc.) into a form, submit it, and receive a list of furniture items available for purchase.

## Specifications

* A user should be able to enter a furniture type to receive a list of furniture items that fit the search query.
* If the query response includes any items, the following information should be included about each item: name of piece, a picture of the item, a brief description, available colors, whether or not the item can be delivered, and how many if any are availble.
* If the API call results in an error (any message not a 200 OK), the application should return a notification that states what the error is.
* If the query response doesn't include any furniture items (for instance, if no items meet the search criteria), the application should return a notification that states that no furniture items meet the criteria. (This is not an error so it should be handled separately from any errors.)
